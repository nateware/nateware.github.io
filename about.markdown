I've been messing with computers since my Dad brought home a Commodore 64 when I was 10 years old. From there we built several PC's from scratch and I fondly remember us "splurging" for the larger hard disk - 40MB vs 25MB! I think we paid an extra $200, which was a lot of money in the 80's.

But I was never going to go into computers. I went to [UCSD](https://www.ucsd.edu/) to study [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) - neuroscience and artificial intelligence before "AI" was all the rave. This is back when [Lisp](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)>) was still a thing, Java was brand new, and Python was nowhere to be found. Yeah, I'm that old - oh, "experienced", sorry.

I fell into the original [dotcom boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) when I graduated and landed a job at Sun Microsystems (RIP). A one year break turned into 2, 3... but it was so much fun. Sun San Diego was an [acquisition of Cray Business Systems](https://www.hpcwire.com/1996/05/17/sun-intends-to-purchase-crays-business-systems-division/), and worked on the [Sun e10k Starfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skookum/comments/lesiq5/meet_the_sun_starfire_ultra_enterprise_10000_e10k/). This was a massive refrigerator-sized machine and everyone - eBay, AT&T, every XYZ.com startup - decided they needed one. We had Friday keg parties between the buildings while they backed up dumptrucks of cash. Not exaggerating - ask anyone who was there.

My boss at Sun coined the term **Nateware &trade;** in reference to the staggering number of Perl scripts I turned out back then (most of them of dubious quality). I released a few open source Perl modules, notably [CGI::FormBuilder](https://metacpan.org/pod/CGI::FormBuilder) and [SQL::Abstract](https://metacpan.org/pod/SQL::Abstract). But all good things come to an end - or in this case a staggering crash - and when the guy next to me got laid off, I decided it was time to go.

From there I went to Sony PlayStation where I built a system called GLUE that was used to deploy online games worldwide. v1 was written in Perl (of course) but a coworker inspired me to learn Ruby on Rails, so v2 was built in that. Because of the real-time nature of online games, we needed high concurrency, which led me to get pretty deep into networking and atomicity. I wrote an [An Atomic Rant](https://nateware.com/2010/02/18/an-atomic-rant/) and released the [redis-objects](https://github.com/nateware/redis-objects) Rubygem in late 2009.

At the same time, AWS was starting to gain some buzz as the new kid on the block. I was an instant believer as back at Sun we were working on virtual systems and datacenter automation - so I became an early adopter fanboy and started bringing it into PlayStation. There was a tons of skepticism, but eventually people got past that, and after getting to join the AWS Customer Advisory Board (CAB) I discovered I loved working on cloud more than video games.

I joined AWS in the early days - right before the [first Re:Invent in 2012](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-november-26-2012/). At the time where were 6,000 people who attended which I thought was mind blowing. When I was on the CAB it was a room of 30 people - smart people mind you, CTO's of NASA, Netflix, Reddit, etc - but
