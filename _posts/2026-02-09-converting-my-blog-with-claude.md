I

this is a personal blog written in jekyll. i want to convert my existing wordpress blog into jekyll posts. my blog is located at: nateware.com . for each post on my blog, please create a corresponding markdown file. respect any of the formatting in my existing blog - headers, code segments, links, etc. for each existing blog post, create a new jekyll markdown file in the \_posts directory formatted as YYYY-MM-DD-[slug from existing blog]. For example my blog article located at https://nateware.com/2010/02/18/an-atomic-rant/ should be downloaded, converted to markdown, and saved as \_posts/2010-02-18-an-atomic-rant.md. Create a plan
