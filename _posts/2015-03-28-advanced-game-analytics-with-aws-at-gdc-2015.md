Based on the response to my [GDC 2014 talk](/2014/03/21/game-analytics-with-aws-at-gdc-2014/), I gave an expanded talk on game analytics at GDC 2015. You can [watch the video for free in the GDC Vault](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021876/Connecting-with-Your-Customers-Building).

Launching a successful free-to-play game or mobile app requires having in-depth, real-time analytics about your users. This is easier said than done, but hopefully the above video provides some insight.
